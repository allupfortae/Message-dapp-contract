# This was my first contract project made with solidity progamming languge

What did you learn?
- I learned a lot of more things about blockchain and contracts safety
- Learned and understood more about mappings and arrays since they work different in some way in solidity
- Also connected this contract to my frontend 
- Learned testing a lot of testing and I enjoyed doing the testing lol

What's the app about?
- The app is just a real simple messaging app on the blockchain
- Made it to where no messages can be traceable any back and forth text is only be seen by you and the other person you texting
